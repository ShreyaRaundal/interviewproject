Absolutely! Here’s a concise and impactful way to explain your **Secure Video Steganography System** in an interview:

---

**Project Title:** Secure Video Steganography System

**Overview:**  
This project is a secure data-hiding and sharing platform that combines three powerful security technologies: **Steganography**, **Cryptography**, and **Visual Secret Sharing (VSS)**. The main goal is to provide multi-layered security for sensitive information, ensuring that data remains confidential, tamper-proof, and can only be accessed by authorized users.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Layered Security:**  
  - **Steganography** hides data inside media files (like images, QR codes, or video frames).
  - **Cryptography** (MD5 hashing) encrypts the hidden data.
  - **Visual Secret Sharing (VSS)** splits the encrypted data into multiple “shares” so that only combining them reveals the secret.
- **Custom Encoding/Decoding:**  
  - Converts text into “meaningful sentences” for obfuscation, and decodes it back.
- **QR Code Hiding:**  
  - Supports hiding data inside QR codes for easy sharing.
- **User-Friendly Java GUI:**  
  - Simple interface for hiding and retrieving data.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Java (Eclipse IDE), MySQL (with JDBC connector), runs on Windows.

**How it works (High-Level):**
1. **Data Input:** User provides sensitive data to hide.
2. **Encoding & Encryption:** Data is encoded and encrypted.
3. **Steganography:** Encrypted data is hidden inside a media file (image, video frame, or QR code).
4. **Secret Sharing:** The media file can be split into multiple shares (using VSS) — only by combining these shares can the original secret be reconstructed.
5. **Decoding & Retrieval:** The authorized user combines shares, extracts the hidden data, and decrypts it to retrieve the original message.

**Why is this secure?**  
Most systems use only encryption or only steganography, which have vulnerabilities. By combining multiple techniques, even if one layer is broken, the others still protect the data. For example, if someone finds the hidden file, they still need to decrypt it and combine all shares to access the original information.

**Project Methodology:**  
Developed using the **Iterative SDLC model**, which allowed us to add features and refine security step-by-step.

**Team & My Role:**  
- Collaborated with a team of four.
- Personally contributed to [describe your main contributions: e.g., implementing the GUI, writing the steganography logic, handling database connections, etc.].

**Impact:**  
This project demonstrates how integrating multiple security approaches can make data protection much more robust and resilient to attacks.

Here’s how to elaborate this for your interview, including what queries you wrote and the kind of data your database managed:

---

**Database Integration (My Role):**

- I set up and configured the MySQL database to store user credentials, share metadata, and activity logs for the secure data sharing system.
- I wrote SQL scripts for initializing the database schema and provided CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through JDBC in Java.

**Example of Data in the Database:**

1. **User Table:**  
   Stores user info for authentication and authorization.
   - Columns: id, username, password_hash, email, created_at

2. **Shares Table:**  
   Manages metadata about each secret share.
   - Columns: id, user_id, share_data (encrypted or as file path), created_at, status

3. **Logs Table:**  
   Tracks actions like embedding or retrieving secrets.
   - Columns: id, user_id, action, status, timestamp

**Sample SQL Queries I wrote:**

- Creating the Users Table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100),
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

- Inserting a New User:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, email)
    VALUES ('alice', 'encrypted_hash', 'alice@email.com');
    ```

- Storing a Secret Share:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO shares (user_id, share_data, created_at, status)
    VALUES (1, 'path/to/share.png', NOW(), 'sent');
    ```

- Logging an Activity:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO logs (user_id, action, status, timestamp)
    VALUES (1, 'Embedded Secret', 'success', NOW());
    ```

**Connectivity:**  
- I managed the database connection in Java using JDBC, configuring the connection URL, username, and password in the `DBConnection.java` file.

Here’s how you can explain what you did with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) in your Secure Video Steganography System project:

---

**JDBC Integration – What I Did:**

- I set up the JDBC connection between our Java application and the MySQL database.
- In the code (specifically in `DBConnection.java`), I configured the JDBC URL, username, and password to enable connectivity.
- I wrote methods to establish and close the database connection, ensuring efficient resource management and error handling.
- I implemented SQL queries (like INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE) using Java’s `PreparedStatement` and `Statement` objects to securely interact with the database.
- I handled exceptions to manage connection failures, SQL errors, and ensured user feedback.
- I tested the connection by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, confirming proper data flow between the Java app and the database.

---

**Sample JDBC Code Snippet (DBConnection.java):**
```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DBConnection {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
    private static final String USER = "root";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "root";

    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
    }
}
```

**How to Describe in Interview:**
> “I was responsible for integrating our Java application with MySQL using JDBC. I wrote the code to establish secure connections, execute SQL queries, and handle exceptions. This allowed the application to store and retrieve user credentials, shares, and logs from the database efficiently.”

If you want a more detailed code example (like executing a query or closing a connection), let me know!

**How to Say It in Interview:**

> “I was responsible for setting up the MySQL database, writing table creation and data manipulation queries, and integrating the database with our Java application using JDBC. The database tracked users, managed secret shares, and logged all key actions for security and auditing purposes.”

Let me know if you want table schemas, more query examples, or a code snippet for JDBC connection!

**Tips for Interview:**
- Emphasize the “multi-layered” approach and why it’s more secure.
- Give a real-world analogy (e.g., “It’s like locking a box, hiding the box in a painting, and then splitting the painting into puzzle pieces”).
- Briefly mention technologies and your contributions.
- Be ready to answer how each security layer works.
