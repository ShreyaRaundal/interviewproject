Absolutely! Here’s a concise and impactful way to explain your **Secure Video Steganography System** in an interview:

---

**Project Title:** Secure Video Steganography System

**Overview:**  
This project is a secure data-hiding and sharing platform that combines three powerful security technologies: **Steganography**, **Cryptography**, and **Visual Secret Sharing (VSS)**. The main goal is to provide multi-layered security for sensitive information, ensuring that data remains confidential, tamper-proof, and can only be accessed by authorized users.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Layered Security:**  
  - **Steganography** hides data inside media files (like images, QR codes, or video frames).
  - **Cryptography** (MD5 hashing) encrypts the hidden data.
  - **Visual Secret Sharing (VSS)** splits the encrypted data into multiple “shares” so that only combining them reveals the secret.
- **Custom Encoding/Decoding:**  
  - Converts text into “meaningful sentences” for obfuscation, and decodes it back.
- **QR Code Hiding:**  
  - Supports hiding data inside QR codes for easy sharing.
- **User-Friendly Java GUI:**  
  - Simple interface for hiding and retrieving data.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Java (Eclipse IDE), MySQL (with JDBC connector), runs on Windows.

**How it works (High-Level):**
1. **Data Input:** User provides sensitive data to hide.
2. **Encoding & Encryption:** Data is encoded and encrypted.
3. **Steganography:** Encrypted data is hidden inside a media file (image, video frame, or QR code).
4. **Secret Sharing:** The media file can be split into multiple shares (using VSS) — only by combining these shares can the original secret be reconstructed.
5. **Decoding & Retrieval:** The authorized user combines shares, extracts the hidden data, and decrypts it to retrieve the original message.

**Why is this secure?**  
Most systems use only encryption or only steganography, which have vulnerabilities. By combining multiple techniques, even if one layer is broken, the others still protect the data. For example, if someone finds the hidden file, they still need to decrypt it and combine all shares to access the original information.

**Project Methodology:**  
Developed using the **Iterative SDLC model**, which allowed us to add features and refine security step-by-step.

**Team & My Role:**  
- Collaborated with a team of four.
- Personally contributed to [describe your main contributions: e.g., implementing the GUI, writing the steganography logic, handling database connections, etc.].

**Impact:**  
This project demonstrates how integrating multiple security approaches can make data protection much more robust and resilient to attacks.

**Tips for Interview:**
- Emphasize the “multi-layered” approach and why it’s more secure.
- Give a real-world analogy (e.g., “It’s like locking a box, hiding the box in a painting, and then splitting the painting into puzzle pieces”).
- Briefly mention technologies and your contributions.
- Be ready to answer how each security layer works.
